x-bit = 2^X
y-bit = 2^y

Result of using y-bit over x-bit: 2^(y-x)


Bit

a "bit", like an atom, the smallest unit of storage
A bit stores just a 0 or 1
"In the computer it's all 0's and 1's" ... bits
Anything with two separate states can store 1 bit 
 -Nick's tennis racket example
In a chip: electric charge = 0/1
In a hard drive: spots of North/South magnetism = 0/1
A bit is too small to be much use
Group 8 bits together to make 1 byte


Byte

One byte = grouping of 8 bits
e.g. 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
One byte can store one character, e.g. 'A' or 'x' or '$'
